A can perform many administrative actions in yer gruips, just add me as an administrator and send /administration tae adjust the settings for yer gruip.

â€¢ /pin <text> - Send a Markdoun-formatted message which can be edited by using the same commaund with different text, tae save ye from having tae re-pin a message if ye can't edit it (which happens if the message is older than 48 hours)

â€¢ /ban - Ban a usar by replying tae one of thair messages, ore by specifying them by usarname/ID

â€¢ /kick - Kick (ban and then unban) a usar by replying tae one of thair messages, ore by specifying them by usarname/ID

â€¢ /unban - Unban a usar by replying tae one of thair messages, ore by specifying them by usarname/ID

â€¢ /setrules <text> - Set the given Markdoun-formatted text as the gruip rules, which will be sent whenever somebody uses /rules

â€¢ /setwelcome - Set the given Markdoun-formatted text as a welcome message that will be sent every time a usar joins yer gruip (the welcome message can be disabled in the administration menu, accessible via /administration). Ye can use placeholders tae automatically customise the welcome message for each usar. Use $usar\_id tae insert the usar's numerical ID, $chat\_id tae insert the tauk's numerical ID, $name tae insert the usar's name, $title tae insert the tauk title and $usarname tae insert the usar's usarname (if the usar doesn't have an @usarname, thair name will be used instead, so it is best tae avoid using thes with $name)

â€¢ /warn - Warn a usar, and ban them when thei hit the maximum number of warnings

â€¢ /mod - Promote the replied-to usar, giving them access tae administrative commands such as /ban, /kick, /warn etc. (this is useful when ye don't want somebody tae have the ability tae delete messages!)

â€¢ /demod - Demote the replied-to usar, stripping them from thair moderation status and revoking thair ability tae use administrative commands

â€¢ /staff - veu the gruip's creator, administrators, and moderators in a neatly-formatted list
        ]],
        ['11'] = [[
â€¢ /report - Forwards the replied-to message tae all administrators and alerts them of the current situation

â€¢ /setlink <URL> - Set the gruip's link tae the given URL, which will be sent whenever somebody uses /link
