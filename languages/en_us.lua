I can perform many administrative actions in your groups, just add me as an administrator and send /administration to adjust the settings for your group.
Here are some administrative commands and a brief comment regarding what they do:

â€¢ /pin <text> - Send a Markdown-formatted message which can be edited by using the same command with different text, to save you from having to re-pin a message if you can't edit it (which happens if the message is older than 48 hours)

â€¢ /ban - Ban a user by replying to one of their messages, or by specifying them by username/ID

â€¢ /kick - Kick (ban and then unban) a user by replying to one of their messages, or by specifying them by username/ID

â€¢ /unban - Unban a user by replying to one of their messages, or by specifying them by username/ID

â€¢ /setrules <text> - Set the given Markdown-formatted text as the group rules, which will be sent whenever somebody uses /rules

â€¢ /trust - Promotes an user to a trusted user of the current chat. This command can only be used by administrators of a supergroup. Admins can set their permissions to be immune to some filters.
        ]],
        ['10'] = [[
â€¢ /setwelcome - Set the given Markdown-formatted text as a welcome message that will be sent every time a user joins your group (the welcome message can be disabled in the administration menu, accessible via /administration). You can use placeholders to automatically customise the welcome message for each user. Use $user\_id to insert the user's numerical ID, $chat\_id to insert the chat's numerical ID, $name to insert the user's name, $title to insert the chat title and $username to insert the user's username (if the user doesn't have an @username, their name will be used instead, so it is best to avoid using this with $name)

â€¢ /warn - Warn a user, and ban them when they hit the maximum number of warnings

â€¢ /mod - Promote the replied-to user, giving them access to administrative commands such as /ban, /kick, /warn etc. (this is useful when you don't want somebody to have the ability to delete messages!)

â€¢ /demod - Demote the replied-to user, stripping them from their moderation status and revoking their ability to use administrative commands

â€¢ /staff - View the group's creator, administrators, and moderators in a neatly-formatted list
        ]],
        ['11'] = [[
â€¢ /report - Forwards the replied-to message to all administrators and alerts them of the current situation

â€¢ /setlink <URL> - Set the group's link to the given URL, which will be sent whenever somebody uses /link

â€¢ /links <text> - Whitelists all of the Telegram links found in the given text (includes @username links)
